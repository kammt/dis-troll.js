# dis-troll.js
A JS script that starts to play discord ping/call sounds after site inactivity

## I love my website visitors: So how do add this on my website?
Easy peasy! 
1. Add the script to your site:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kammt/dis-troll.js/dis-troll.js"></script>
```
2. Every time the user interacts with the site (e.g. clicks a button), call the `startDistrollTimer` function. \
FYI: when called again, the old timer is replaced with a new timer, meaning that the user will only get beautiful sounds when he stops interacting with the website
3. Wait for happy customer reviews.
